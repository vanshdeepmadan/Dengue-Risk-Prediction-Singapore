# Dengue-Risk-Prediction-Singapore
	•Developed a machine learning-based classification system to predict high-risk and low-risk dengue weeks using dengue case data for Singapore.
 
	•Selected Singapore for its relatively small size and climate uniformity, ensuring that country-level climate data could be reliably used for prediction.
 
	•Conducted feature engineering by creating lagged and rolling features for climate data (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and derived interaction terms to enhance predictive accuracy.
 
	•Implemented and compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), with XGBoost achieving the best performance, attaining an ROC-AUC score of 0.80
 
	•Addressed the challenge of country-level dengue case tracking by designing models capable of leveraging uniform climate data to predict outbreaks.
