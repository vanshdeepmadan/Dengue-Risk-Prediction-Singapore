# Dengue-Risk-Prediction-Singapore
• Built a classification model to predict high-risk dengue weeks using climate and case data for Singapore.
• Selected Singapore as the study area due to its climate uniformity, addressing challenges in country-level dengue case tracking.
• Engineered lagged and rolling climate features, such as rainfall and temperature patterns, to enhance model performance.
• Achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.80 with XGBoost, providing insights into the relationship between climatic factors and disease outbreaks.
